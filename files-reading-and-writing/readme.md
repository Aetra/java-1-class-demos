## Agenda, new content

 - Reading a file in,

 - reading + writing at the same time.
 - What is grep?
 - What are we building for the homework assignment?


## Datasets

I have pulled a few datasets from data.gov:

```
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset
```

We will use these to play around with reading files and pulling data out. This is a good place to go if you want to
get large CSV data dumps full of interesting (actually, mostly not so interesting) statistics and raw data.
