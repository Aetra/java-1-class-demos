# Week 1

Week one is an introduction to java. We will do a little bit of programming but mostly talking.

## Objectives (per syllabus):

Review of computer operations and an introduction to the Java SDK, editor and compiler.  Main and the first program: “Hello World.”  Variables: defining, initializing, outputting with printf, math operations.

### Agenda:

 1. Introductions
 2. syllabus
 3. Coding Standards (make things: easy to read, simple, idiomatic)
 4. What is Java?
  1. The language (C-Style, mandatory object orientation, namespace system, library system)
  2. The history (Sun microsystems, Oracle)
  3. The use cases (web applets, gui apps, server apps)
  4. Architecture (JVM, bytecode, garbage collection, object oriented)
  5. editors / ides (Eclipse, other)
  6. compiler / runtime
 5. Hello World
 6. Hello arguments
 7. Break: get everyone set up
  1. JDK vs JRE
  2. Java version 8 vs previous versions?
  3. java -version
  4. javac -version
 8. What are DataTypes (run java program)
  1. How does memory work in the jvm for each data type.
  2. How do you declare Variables
  3. How do you combine them?
  4. How do you translate between them?
  5. How do you represent them?



### Java Installation

First, you need to download + install the JDK (java dev kit)
[java download site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

You can see if it is installed with these commands.
```
java -version
javac -version
```

Java is the runtime, while javac is the compiler. Because we are writing code and not just
running it, you will need both.


### Eclipse Installation

We will use Java 8 and eclipse for this class. Actually, you can use whatever you want as far as editors go.
Eclipse just happens to be free and well known in the industry. At work, I use an IDE called
IntelliJ, which is not free. They have a more limited free version though, so use it if you like.

### Online editors

If you happen to have trouble getting set up and just need to work on an assignment immediately,
you can always try an online code editor/compiler. Please understand that anything you type
on one of these sites is going to be entered into somebody's server somewhere.
