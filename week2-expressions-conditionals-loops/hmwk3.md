## Step 1

Put the following in 1 program (e.g. CHomework3A):

 - Write a loop that will print all the whole numbers from 1 to 100.
 - Write a loop that will add all the whole numbers from 1 to 1000 and print only the total.
 - Write a loop that will add all the ODD numbers from 1 to 300 and print only the total.
 - Write a loop that will add all the EVEN numbers from 2 to 146 and print only the total.
 - Write a loop that will add every 3rd number from 2000 to 6 and print the total. DO NOT flip the numbers around and count from 6 to 2000.


## Step 2

Put the following in 1 program (e.g. CHomework3B):

 - Read in an integer value from the user and print out if the number is even or odd.
 - Read in an integer value from the user from 1 and 100.  Loop until a value in that range is entered.  After a number in that range is entered print it out.


## Step 3

Zip both your .java files and submit them to Blackboard.
