## Datasets

I have pulled a few datasets from data.gov:

```
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset
```

We will use these to play around with reading files and pulling data out. This is a good place to go if you want to
get large CSV data dumps full of interesting (actually, mostly not so interesting) statistics and raw data.

## Reading files.

## Writing files.

options to write files:

 - CREATE
 - CREATE_NEW
 - DELETE_ON_CLOSE
 - APPEND
 - TRUNCATE_EXISTING
 - WRITE
